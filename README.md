I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Rock Paper Scissors" is the third project in the Foundations course, which tests basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create a game of Rock Paper Scissors. In the first phase of this project, only a console version of Rock Paper Scissors was implemented, while in the second and final phase, a very basic UI was implemented.
